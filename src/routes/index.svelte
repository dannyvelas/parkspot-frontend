    <h2>Parking Regulations</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>A permit request can last from 1 day to 15 days.</b> If a resident wants their guest to park
        for longer than 15 days, they must submit another request after their first 15 day request expires.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Each resident can give out max 20 days worth of parking permits per year.</b>
        In order to park for 20 days continously, a resident must apply for two consecutive permits of
        15 days.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Each guest car can park max 20 days with temporary parking permits per year.</b>
        If a guest car has already parked 30 days using parking permits, this car does not qualify for
        further parking.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>A resident can have max 2 active permits at a given time.</b>
        If a resident requests a permit to start at a future date, this is considered an "active" request
        even if the future date has not yet arrived. A permit request stops being active once the expiration
        date of the permit arrives.
