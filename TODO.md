## Tech debt
- [x] add env variable for backend URL
- [ ] make error messages more abstracted and user friendly in login page
- [ ] make `credentials=true` in fetch options, only work in dev if it's not necessary in prod
- [ ] make svelte not sign you out on re-fresh
- [ ] show actual number of all permits instead of just the amount on the page
## Missing From Spec
- [ ] search functionality
- [ ] pages
## Won't do
- [✗] make params a `{}` argument or use generated types in index.svelte
    * little value
- [✗] strongly type the Props of every `load` func.
    * little value
